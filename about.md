Welcome to my site! I'm Jon and I made a blog to ramble on about
nothing. I work as a Software Engineer for [Fullscreen
Media](http://fullscreen.com). You can find me on
[LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/jonwho) or
[GitHub](http://github.com/jonwho).

Everyday my goal is to cure my boredom. My cures range from video
games like League of Legends to CS:GO and programming projects. I
think it's vital to be curious and JavaScript standards change
everyday so it's hard to stay bored for too long.
